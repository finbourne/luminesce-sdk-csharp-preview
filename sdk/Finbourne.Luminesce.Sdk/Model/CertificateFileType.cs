It is proprietary technology designed and developed by FINBOURNE Technology Limited.  [Understanding the Luminesce platform architecture.](https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01707/)  Luminesce enables you to query multiple sources of business intelligence simultaneously in real-time—including investment management data stored in LUSID itself—and build a consolidated picture for analysis, optionally writing data back into LUSID. Alternatively, you can use Luminesce in a standalone capacity, without interacting with LUSID at all.  ### WebAPI  Allows for running queries and a variety of other functions relating to Luminesce. For example these REST APIs can execute queries, synchronously or better asynchronously, returning results in either Excel, CSV, SqLite, JSON among other formats.     ### Error Codes  | Code|Meaning | | - --|- -- | | <a name=\"233\">233</a>|Query Parser Failure | | <a name=\"850\">850</a>|Required provider not visible; provider may not exist, be temporarily unavailable, or you may not have the necessary permissions | | <a name=\"851\">851</a>|Query reached a timeout period or was cancelled | | <a name=\"852\">852</a>|Query failed during execution | | <a name=\"853\">853</a>|Query failed during execution for an unexpected reason | | <a name=\"854\">854</a>|Query failed during execution for a reason known to be an internal error (e.g. a Lusid provider where a corresponding API would return a 500) | | <a name=\"855\">855</a>|Required column is not in the queried provider(s) | | <a name=\"856\">856</a>|One or more columns are ambiguously referenced in the query | | <a name=\"857\">857</a>|Query failed during execution of a provider (e.g. in a way that might be transient, like an upstream issue) | | <a name=\"858\">858</a>|Query failed during execution within the Query Engine's SQL processing | | <a name=\"859\">859</a>|A variable has been defined more than once |
