FetchQueryResultCsv: Fetches the result of a query as CSV

Fetch the data in the format of the method's name (if available, or if not simply being informed it is not yet ready).  The following error codes are to be anticipated most with standard Problem Detail reports: - 400 BadRequest : Something failed with the execution of your query - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden - 404 Not Found : The requested query result doesn't (yet) exist. - 429 Too Many Requests : Please try your request again soon   1. The query has been executed successfully in the past yet the server-instance receiving this request (e.g. from a load balancer) doesn't yet have this data available.   1. By virtue of the request you have just placed this will have started to load from the persisted cache and will soon be available.   1. It is also the case that the original server-instance to process the original query is likely to already be able to service this request.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Api;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Client;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class FetchQueryResultCsvExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new SqlBackgroundExecutionApi(config);
            var executionId = executionId_example;  // string | ExecutionId returned when starting the query
            var download = true;  // bool? | Makes this a file-download request (as opposed to returning the data in the response-body) (optional)  (default to false)
            var sortBy = sortBy_example;  // string | Order the results by these fields.              Use the `-` sign to denote descending order, e.g. `-MyFieldName`.  Numeric indexes may be used also, e.g. `2,-3`.              Multiple fields can be denoted by a comma e.g. `-MyFieldName,AnotherFieldName,-AFurtherFieldName`.              Default is null, the sort order specified in the query itself. (optional) 
            var filter = filter_example;  // string | An ODATA filter per Finbourne.Filtering syntax. (optional) 
            var select = select_example;  // string | Default is null (meaning return all columns in the original query itself).  The values are in terms of the result column name from the original data set and are comma delimited.  The power of this comes in that you may aggregate the data if you wish  (that is the main reason for allowing this, in fact).  e.g.:  - `MyField`  - `Max(x) FILTER (WHERE y > 12) as ABC` (max of a field, if another field lets it qualify, with a nice column name)  - `count(*)` (count the rows for the given group, that would produce a rather ugly column name, but  it works)  - `count(distinct x) as numOfXs`  If there was an illegal character in a field you are selecting from, you are responsible for bracketing it with [ ].   e.g.  - `some_field, count(*) as a, max(x) as b, min([column with space in name]) as nice_name`    where you would likely want to pass `1` as the `groupBy` also. (optional) 
            var groupBy = groupBy_example;  // string | Groups by the specified fields.              A comma delimited list of: 1 based numeric indexes (cleaner), or repeats of the select expressions (a bit verbose and must match exactly).              e.g. `2,3`, `myColumn`.              Default is null (meaning no grouping will be performed on the selected columns).              This applies only over the result set being requested here, meaning indexes into the \"select\" parameter fields.              Only specify this if you are selecting aggregations in the \"select\" parameter. (optional) 
            var limit = 56;  // int? | When paginating, only return this number of records, page should also be specified. (optional)  (default to 0)
            var page = 56;  // int? | 0-N based on chunk sized determined by the limit, ignored if limit < 1. (optional)  (default to 0)
            var delimiter = delimiter_example;  // string | Delimiter string to override the default (optional) 
            var escape = escape_example;  // string | Escape character to override the default (optional) 

            try
            {
                // FetchQueryResultCsv: Fetches the result of a query as CSV
                string result = apiInstance.FetchQueryResultCsv(executionId, download, sortBy, filter, select, groupBy, limit, page, delimiter, escape);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling SqlBackgroundExecutionApi.FetchQueryResultCsv: " + e.Message );

FetchQueryResultJson: Fetches the result of a query as a JSON string

 *Please move to '/jsonProper' instead.  This may be marked as Deprecated in the future.*  Fetch the data in the format of the method's name (if available, or if not simply being informed it is not yet ready).  The following error codes are to be anticipated most with standard Problem Detail reports: - 400 BadRequest : Something failed with the execution of your query - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden - 404 Not Found : The requested query result doesn't (yet) exist. - 429 Too Many Requests : Please try your request again soon   1. The query has been executed successfully in the past yet the server-instance receiving this request (e.g. from a load balancer) doesn't yet have this data available.   1. By virtue of the request you have just placed this will have started to load from the persisted cache and will soon be available.   1. It is also the case that the original server-instance to process the original query is likely to already be able to service this request.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Api;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Client;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class FetchQueryResultJsonExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new SqlBackgroundExecutionApi(config);
            var executionId = executionId_example;  // string | ExecutionId returned when starting the query
            var sortBy = sortBy_example;  // string | Order the results by these fields.              Use the `-` sign to denote descending order, e.g. `-MyFieldName`.  Numeric indexes may be used also, e.g. `2,-3`.              Multiple fields can be denoted by a comma e.g. `-MyFieldName,AnotherFieldName,-AFurtherFieldName`.              Default is null, the sort order specified in the query itself. (optional) 
            var filter = filter_example;  // string | An ODATA filter per Finbourne.Filtering syntax. (optional) 
            var select = select_example;  // string | Default is null (meaning return all columns in the original query itself).  The values are in terms of the result column name from the original data set and are comma delimited.  The power of this comes in that you may aggregate the data if you wish  (that is the main reason for allowing this, in fact).  e.g.:  - `MyField`  - `Max(x) FILTER (WHERE y > 12) as ABC` (max of a field, if another field lets it qualify, with a nice column name)  - `count(*)` (count the rows for the given group, that would produce a rather ugly column name, but  it works)  - `count(distinct x) as numOfXs`  If there was an illegal character in a field you are selecting from, you are responsible for bracketing it with [ ].   e.g.  - `some_field, count(*) as a, max(x) as b, min([column with space in name]) as nice_name`    where you would likely want to pass `1` as the `groupBy` also. (optional) 
            var groupBy = groupBy_example;  // string | Groups by the specified fields.              A comma delimited list of: 1 based numeric indexes (cleaner), or repeats of the select expressions (a bit verbose and must match exactly).              e.g. `2,3`, `myColumn`.              Default is null (meaning no grouping will be performed on the selected columns).              This applies only over the result set being requested here, meaning indexes into the \"select\" parameter fields.              Only specify this if you are selecting aggregations in the \"select\" parameter. (optional) 
            var limit = 56;  // int? | When paginating, only return this number of records, page should also be specified. (optional)  (default to 0)
            var page = 56;  // int? | 0-N based on chunk sized determined by the limit, ignored if limit < 1. (optional)  (default to 0)

            try
            {
                // FetchQueryResultJson: Fetches the result of a query as a JSON string
                string result = apiInstance.FetchQueryResultJson(executionId, sortBy, filter, select, groupBy, limit, page);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);

> string FetchQueryResultPipe (string executionId, bool? download = null, string sortBy = null, string filter = null, string select = null, string groupBy = null, int? limit = null, int? page = null)

FetchQueryResultPipe: Fetches the result of a query as pipe-delimited

Fetch the data in the format of the method's name (if available, or if not simply being informed it is not yet ready).  The following error codes are to be anticipated most with standard Problem Detail reports: - 400 BadRequest : Something failed with the execution of your query - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden - 404 Not Found : The requested query result doesn't (yet) exist. - 429 Too Many Requests : Please try your request again soon   1. The query has been executed successfully in the past yet the server-instance receiving this request (e.g. from a load balancer) doesn't yet have this data available.   1. By virtue of the request you have just placed this will have started to load from the persisted cache and will soon be available.   1. It is also the case that the original server-instance to process the original query is likely to already be able to service this request.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Api;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Client;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class FetchQueryResultPipeExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new SqlBackgroundExecutionApi(config);
            var executionId = executionId_example;  // string | ExecutionId returned when starting the query
            var download = true;  // bool? | Makes this a file-download request (as opposed to returning the data in the response-body) (optional)  (default to false)
            var sortBy = sortBy_example;  // string | Order the results by these fields.              Use the `-` sign to denote descending order, e.g. `-MyFieldName`.  Numeric indexes may be used also, e.g. `2,-3`.              Multiple fields can be denoted by a comma e.g. `-MyFieldName,AnotherFieldName,-AFurtherFieldName`.              Default is null, the sort order specified in the query itself. (optional) 
            var filter = filter_example;  // string | An ODATA filter per Finbourne.Filtering syntax. (optional) 
            var select = select_example;  // string | Default is null (meaning return all columns in the original query itself).  The values are in terms of the result column name from the original data set and are comma delimited.  The power of this comes in that you may aggregate the data if you wish  (that is the main reason for allowing this, in fact).  e.g.:  - `MyField`  - `Max(x) FILTER (WHERE y > 12) as ABC` (max of a field, if another field lets it qualify, with a nice column name)  - `count(*)` (count the rows for the given group, that would produce a rather ugly column name, but  it works)  - `count(distinct x) as numOfXs`  If there was an illegal character in a field you are selecting from, you are responsible for bracketing it with [ ].   e.g.  - `some_field, count(*) as a, max(x) as b, min([column with space in name]) as nice_name`    where you would likely want to pass `1` as the `groupBy` also. (optional) 
            var groupBy = groupBy_example;  // string | Groups by the specified fields.              A comma delimited list of: 1 based numeric indexes (cleaner), or repeats of the select expressions (a bit verbose and must match exactly).              e.g. `2,3`, `myColumn`.              Default is null (meaning no grouping will be performed on the selected columns).              This applies only over the result set being requested here, meaning indexes into the \"select\" parameter fields.              Only specify this if you are selecting aggregations in the \"select\" parameter. (optional) 
            var limit = 56;  // int? | When paginating, only return this number of records, page should also be specified. (optional)  (default to 0)
            var page = 56;  // int? | 0-N based on chunk sized determined by the limit, ignored if limit < 1. (optional)  (default to 0)

            try
            {
                // FetchQueryResultPipe: Fetches the result of a query as pipe-delimited
                string result = apiInstance.FetchQueryResultPipe(executionId, download, sortBy, filter, select, groupBy, limit, page);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);

GetProgressOf: View progress information up until this point

View progress information (up until this point) The following error codes are to be anticipated most with standard Problem Detail reports: - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden - 404 Not Found : The requested query result doesn't exist and is not running. - 429 Too Many Requests : Please try your request again soon   1. The query has been executed successfully in the past yet the server-instance receiving this request (e.g. from a load balancer) doesn't yet have this data available.   1. By virtue of the request you have just placed this will have started to load from the persisted cache and will soon be available.   1. It is also the case that the original server-instance to process the original query is likely to already be able to service this request.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Api;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Client;
using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetProgressOfExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new SqlBackgroundExecutionApi(config);
            var executionId = executionId_example;  // string | ExecutionId returned when starting the query
            var buildFromLogs = true;  // bool? | Should the response state be build from query logs if missing from the shared-db-state?  False will mean `404 Not Found` in cases where it was a real query but has passed its `keepForSeconds`  since the query completed (as well as 'this was not a query at all' of course) (optional)  (default to true)

            try
            {
                // GetProgressOf: View progress information up until this point
                BackgroundQueryProgressResponse result = apiInstance.GetProgressOf(executionId, buildFromLogs);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling SqlBackgroundExecutionApi.GetProgressOf: " + e.Message );
                Debug.Print("Status Code: "+ e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }

# **StartQuery**

StartQuery: Starts to Execute Sql in the background

 Allow for starting a potentially long running query and getting back an immediate response with how to  - fetch the data in various formats (if available, or if not simply being informed it is not yet ready) - view progress information (up until this point) - cancel the query (if still running) / clear the data (if already returned)  This can still error on things like an outright syntax error, but more runtime errors (e.g. from providers) will not cause this to error (that will happen when attempting to fetch data)  Here is an example that intentionally takes one minute to run:  ```sql select Str, Takes500Ms from Testing1K where UseLinq = true and [Int] <= 120 ```  This is the only place in the Luminesce WebAPI where the following is supported. This will allow for the same user running a character-identical query not kick off a new query but simply be returned a reference  to the already running one for up to `N` seconds (where `N` should be `<=` `keepForSeconds`).  The following error codes are to be anticipated with standard Problem Detail reports: - 400 BadRequest - there was something wrong with your query syntax (the issue was detected at parse-time) - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

using Finbourne.Luminesce.Sdk.Api;

            var queryName = Intentionally slow test query;  // string | A name for this query.  This goes into logs and is available in `Sys.Logs.HcQueryStart`. (optional) 
            var timeoutSeconds = 1200;  // int? | Maximum time the query may run for, in seconds: <0 → ∞, 0 → 7200 (2h) (optional)  (default to 0)

            try
            {
